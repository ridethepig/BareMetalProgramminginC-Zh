# Part 2 - The C Runtime

In this part of the tutorial we'll look deeper into the linker and the C-Library so that we end up with a working C-Library link. Exciting stuff, huh?! Let's look further into what the compiler and linker are doing in order to create our bare-metal executable.

The C-Runtime (different to the C-Library!) is currently missing from our code. In a lot of embedded systems the C-Runtime is essential, or else things break instantly. The most notable thing that's instantly visible in most embedded systems is that static variables are not initialised.

This is why in our previous example, we were working without pre-initialised variables. Instead, we initialise the variable in the code at the start of main from a pre-processor define.

> **Github** The code for the tutorials is now on [Github](https://github.com/BrianSidebotham/arm-tutorial-rpi). You can either browse the code, checkout the code, fork, branch, or download [as a zip](https://github.com/BrianSidebotham/arm-tutorial-rpi/archive/master.zip) from GibHub.

## Understanding the C-Runtime Startup

Let's modify and use a pre-initialised variable instead:

part-2/armc-04:

```c
#include "rpi-gpio.h"

/** GPIO Register set */
volatile unsigned int* gpio = (unsigned int*)GPIO_BASE;

/** Simple loop variable */
volatile unsigned int tim;

/** Main function - we'll never return from here */
int main(void)
{
    /* Write 1 to the GPIO16 init nibble in the Function Select 1 GPIO
       peripheral register to enable GPIO16 as an output */
    gpio[LED_GPFSEL] |= (1 &lt;&lt; LED_GPFBIT);

    /* Never exit as there is no OS to exit to! */
    while(1)
    {
        for(tim = 0; tim &lt; 500000; tim++)
            ;

        /* Set the LED GPIO pin low ( Turn OK LED on for original Pi, and off
           for plus models )*/
        gpio[LED_GPCLR] = (1 &lt;&lt; LED_GPIO_BIT);

        for(tim = 0; tim &lt; 500000; tim++)
            ;

        /* Set the LED GPIO pin high ( Turn OK LED off for original Pi, and on
           for plus models )*/
        gpio[LED_GPSET] = (1 &lt;&lt; LED_GPIO_BIT);
    }
}
```

Compile it (using the build*.bat, or build*.sh file) and we notice a few things:

* The size of the binary image is now 33k, but the previous version of this code was only a hundred bytes or so!
* The code, when written to the SDCARD still works - this isn't really expected without a working C-Runtime in place to initialise the variable gpio before calling main!?

In fact, this embedded system is different to a lot because we're loading an entire binary image into RAM and then executing from RAM. The majority of systems have a non-volatile memory section (Flash/ROM) where the executable code resides, and a volatile memory section (RAM) where the variable data resides. Variables exist in RAM, everything has a position in RAM.

When we compile for a target that executes from an image in Flash and uses RAM for variables, we need a copy of the initial values for the variables from Flash so that every time the system is started the variables can be initialised to their initial value, and we need the code in Flash to copy these values into the variables *before* main() is called.

This is one of the jobs of the C-Runtime code (CRT). This is a code object that is normally linked in automagically by your tool-chain. This is usually not the only object to get linked to your code behind your back - usually the Interrupt Vector Table gets linked in too, and a Linker Script tells the linker how to organise these additional pieces of code in your memory layout.

Normally of course, this happens without you knowing. In general, you'll select your processor or embedded system on the command line and the appropriate linker script and C-Runtime is chosen for you and linked in.

I urge you to go and look at your arm-none-gcc-eabi install now to see some of these files. Look under the arm-none-eabi sub-directory and then under the lib sub-directory. The C-Runtime code is a binary object file and is called crt0.o, the C Library for info is an archive of object files called libc.a (there may be several versions with different names), and then you'll have some .ld files. Under the ldscripts subdirectory you'll find the standard linker scripts. It's just worth a look to know they're there. GCC uses a thing called specs files too, which allow specifying system settings so that you can create a machine specification that allows you to target a machine easily. You can select a custom specs file with a command line option for GCC, otherwise gcc uses it's built-in specs.

specs files are considered an advanced subject in the world of the GNU tool-chain, but they provide an excellent way of supplying machine-specific compilation settings. For the embedded engineer they're worth knowing about! :D

So, now we've got two questions, why does our code work - because the initialisation isn't present in the C-Runtime? and, why has our code size jumped from a 100 bytes or so to 33k?

The code works without any initialisation because the variables exist in the same memory space as the code. The bootloading process results in the raspberry-pi kernel being loaded into RAM in order to be executed, the GPU bootloader runs before the ARM processor we're targeting runs, and loads the kernel.img file from disk. Because of this, the variables position within the binary image becomes their variable memory location. The image is loaded by the boot-loader at address 0x8000 and then executed. So the bootloader has essentially done a taskt that the C-Runtime would normally do, copy the initial values of initialised variables from non-volatile memory to volatile memory. Cool.

Look at the code produced closer with a disassembler. You've already got a disassembler! It comes with the toolchain; Weclome to the world of objdump (or in our case arm-non-eabi-objdump). We diassemble the elf file because then objdump knows what processor the binary was built for. It also then has knowledge of the different code sections too. There's a disassemble.bat and disassemble.sh script so go ahead and disassemble the code to see what the compiler generated. You'll get a kernel.asm file that looks similar to if not the same as the following (RPI2) code:

```
Disassembly of section .text:

Disassembly of section .data:

0001008c <__data_start>:
   1008c:   20200000    eorcs   r0, r0, r0
```

The first line loads r2 with the value at the *address* contained at the Program Counter
(PC) + 120. At this address, there's the value 0x1008c. Remember that this file is loaded at
0x8000 by the boot-loader. Virtually all ARM devices are the same in this respect, so the
linker is expecting this to happen. At the base address 0x8000 + an offset of 0x808c (which
is therefore 0x1008c) is the value 0x20200000 which is the value we want the variable gpio
initialised to (for the RPI1, for the RPI2 this will be 0x3F200000. So this is why the code
works without any explicit loading or initialisation, but let's look at exactly what's going on
and find out why it works like this.

The value at the end of our executable image can be viewed by using hex editor:

![Hex Editor View](http://www.valvers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/armc-04-kernel-img-hex-editor.jpg)

The next line however loads r3 with the value at the *address* contained at the PC + 120. At this
address, there's the value 0x10090. This is outside of our binary image size. This variable value
is going to be undefined. This is the tim variable, which is indeed not initialised with anything
until we start using it in a for loop on line 73. (If you know the C-Standard, then you'll know
this is actually incorrect behaviour, but we'll get to that in a bit!)

Let's do a sanity check and make sure we're right:

```
\arm-tutorial-rpi\part-2\armc-04>arm-none-eabi-nm kernel.elf

00010094 A __bss_end__
00010090 A __bss_start
00010090 A __bss_start__
0001008c D __data_start
00010094 A __end__
00010094 A _bss_end__
00010090 A _edata
00010094 A _end
00080000 N _stack
         U _start
0001008c D gpio
00008000 T main
00010090 B tim
```

Yep! We're talking the same as [nm](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/nm.html).
That's good at least!

## Simulation

If you're running on Linux you get the added bonus of having GDB built with a simulator for ARM.
Therefore, at a basic level, you can load and step through code on the simulator. Below, I step
through the armc-04 kernel to show that it really does work. It's great to be able to do this when
you're trying to understand exactly what's going on:

Now let's do an experiment. There's a reason I decoded the value 0x1008c which
is the address of the gpio variable as 0x8000 + 0x808c earlier:

## part-2/armc05.c

```c

#include "rpi-gpio.h"

/** GPIO Register set */
volatile unsigned int* gpio = (unsigned int*)GPIO_BASE;

/** Simple loop variable */
volatile unsigned int tim;

/** Main function - we'll never return from here */
int main(void) __attribute__((naked));
int main(void)
{
    /* Write 1 to the GPIO16 init nibble in the Function Select 1 GPIO
       peripheral register to enable GPIO16 as an output */
    gpio[LED_GPFSEL] |= (1 << LED_GPFBIT);

    /* Never exit as there is no OS to exit to! */
    while(1)
    {
        for(tim = 0; tim < 500000; tim++)
            ;

        /* Set the LED GPIO pin low ( Turn OK LED on for original Pi, and off
           for plus models )*/
        gpio[LED_GPCLR] = (1 << LED_GPIO_BIT);

        for(tim = 0; tim < 500000; tim++)
            ;

        /* Set the LED GPIO pin high ( Turn OK LED off for original Pi, and on
           for plus models )*/
        gpio[LED_GPSET] = (1 << LED_GPIO_BIT);

        for(tim = 0; tim < 500000; tim++)
            ;

        /* Set the LED GPIO pin low ( Turn OK LED on for original Pi, and off
           for plus models )*/
        gpio[LED_GPCLR] = (1 << LED_GPIO_BIT);
    }
}
```

armc-05.c varies only slightly from armc-04.c in that it adds in some code. When we look at this
with nm we see that the __data_start section shifts by the same amount as the code we've added:

```
C:\Users\Brian\Documents\GitHub\arm-tutorial-rpi\part-2\armc-05>arm-none-eabi-nm
 kernel.elf
000100c0 A __bss_end__
000100bc A __bss_start
000100bc A __bss_start__
000100b8 D __data_start
000100c0 A __end__
000100c0 A _bss_end__
000100bc A _edata
000100c0 A _end
00080000 N _stack
         U _start
000100b8 D gpio
00008000 T main
000100bc B tim
```

If we go back to the original disassembled output above, we see that address 0x8c (0x1008c - (0x8000 * 2)) is the next available memory address after the constants data which is itself immediately after the code section.

I hope you're following this, we're really seeing a "bug" in the linker script. There's no need for us to have this offset. The offset load is correct because when we load this image in RAM the data is indeed going to be + 0x8000 because that's where the boot-loader is going to place the image, but something is spacing the data section away from the constants data.

Let's ask the linker what script it's using by passing it a verbose option: -Wl,-verbose:

```
For RPI1 compilation:

    arm-none-eabi-gcc -O2 \
        -mfpu=vfp \
        -mfloat-abi=hard \
        -march=armv6zk \
        -mtune=arm1176jzf-s \
        -nostartfiles -g \
        -Wl,-verbose armc-5.c -o kernel.elf
```

As you see from the start of the ld verbose output:

```
GNU ld (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 2.24.0.20141128
  Supported emulations:
   armelf
using internal linker script:
==================================================
```

LD is using an internal linker script. That means the linker script it's using is compiled into the ld executable. That means we can't edit the linker script. The linker can accept another linker script that we can provide. Grab a copy of the default linker script, I just grabbed it from the verbose output of LD that we just generated! You can name it something like rpi.x. Now we can point the linker to this script.

## part-2/armc-06.c

The code is identical to armc-05.c

However, we add `-Wl,-T,rpi.x` to the compilation command to instruct LD to use a different linker script to the one it was using. We've retained `-Wl,verbose` so we can see what happens.

When passing options to the linker using GCC to compile and link, check the [gcc documentation](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Link-Options.html) which details the options you can pass.

Now we have control of the linker script. We can try to find out what's "wrong". I quote wrong, because technically this works, but we've got an annoying 0x8000 offset. It'll be a pain to debug one day, I know it. Let's find out what we need to do to fix it instead. You can also see how complicated a linker script can get when it needs to deal with C++ sections!

I hope you're staying with me! I know this may seem far removed from C development on the Raspberry-Pi bare-metal, but in fact knowing how your tools work to construct the code is essential later on down the line - heck you wouldn't be getting it up and running on your own from scratch unless you knew at least some of this stuff!

Whilst I'm scan-reading the linker script I'm looking for things that stick out. Most of these sections are not used in our basic example so far, so whatever is messing with us must have a size set, and must be present only when we have something in the initialised variables section which we know from our investigations with nm is the __data_start section (it aligns with the gpio symbol which we initialised).

The "problem" must be between the __data_start section and end of the text section (the symbol main indicated the start of the text section). After a little bit of hunting, I see a comment and an alignment pertaining to the data section on line 101:

```
/* Adjust the address for the data segment.  We want to adjust up to
     the same address within the page on the next page up.  */
  . = ALIGN(CONSTANT (MAXPAGESIZE)) + (. & (CONSTANT (MAXPAGESIZE) - 1));
```

Interesting, we apparently "want" to adjust up to the next page. If I comment this out with a standard C-style comment as can be seen in the rest of the file, we get back down to a size of a few hundred bytes with initialised data. Check again with the output of:

```
arm-none-eabi-objdump -D kernel.elf > kernel.elf.asm
```

```

Use the [ARM instruction set quick reference card](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.qrc0001l/QRC0001_UAL.pdf) to decypher if you're not familiar with ARM assembler.

By the way, as a quick note - the comment in the linker script is entirely useless as it only describes what the code is doing, the worst type of comment! There is no *WHY* in the comment. Why are we wanting to do this? What's the reason for forcing the alignment? Anyway this alignment was forcing the 0x8000 additional offset to our rodata (initialised data) section.

Cool, now the initialised data is tagged immediately on the end of the data and the valueslook sane too! I'll leave you to decode the assembly.

## part-2/armc-07

The code here is the same as part-2/armc-05. Nothing has changed, we'll just modify our linker script. At this point, we can get rid of the annoying _start undefined symbol warning. At the top of the linker script, on line 5 you'll see a line that says `ENTRY(_start)`

In armc-07 we've changed this to read `ENTRY(main)`

The warning will go away at last! But we'll soon learn why we need that _start section for the C-Runtime anyway!

Have a quick check of the sections with nm again, now there's no Undefined sections!

## Sections and C Startup

As we've found out, there are a lot of sections, some which you may not know the meaning of. The .bss section is used for data that is implicitly initialised to 0 at startup (This is mandated by the C Standard). This means that all variables that are statically declared are set to zero initially. Statically declared essentially means global, so local (automatic) variables in a function that are not marked as static do not get initialised to zero if you do not explicitly add an initial value. It's easier with an example, take for example the following C file:

```
    unsigned int var1;
    unsigned int var2;
    unsigned int var3 = 10;

    void function( void )
    {
        unsigned int funcvar1;
        static unsigned int funcvar2;

        /* ... */

    }
```

In the above example var1, var2 and funcvar2 are in the bss section, the rest are not. For more information on the bss section, see the [wikipedia page on it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss)

The linker organises the data and sorts it out into the different sections. In the above, var3 for example goes into the data section. The code is compiled into machine code and then put in the .text section. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_segment) for "a little!" more information about the text section. There can be many text sections and there can be many data sections too. These sections are wild-carded in the linker script to ensure different sections can be defined whilst still knowing whether they are code or data sections.

In our current code (armc-07) the bss section is not valid because it is not being initialised. That's because the C-Startup is missing. This is the importance of the `_start` symbol! The `_start` section is run before the c main() entry point and one of it's jobs is to initialise the bss section. The linker provides us with a couple of symbols for the sections so we know where they start and end. In the startup code all we need to do is loop between the addresses defined by `bss_start` and `bss_end` and set all locations to zero. It's easy when you know what you're meant to do!

The `_startup` code should also setup the stack pointer. We'll need a working stack to get anything useful up and working! The stack is temporary memory space available for functions to use. The compiler tries to use registers for local (automatic) function variables, but if the size of data required by the local variables exceeds the amount of registers available, the compiler uses the stack for the local variables.

So lets go ahead and setup the stack pointer to a sane value and initialise the bss section.

Firstly, we'll set the linker script back to standard so the entry point is the `_start` symbol again, we'll have to generate this symbol and generally we'll need to do this is assembler. We need to setup the stack pointer before we enter the C code so that we're safe to write C which may attempt to use the stack straight away.

Normally the complete startup is done in assembler, including zeroing the bss section, but it doesn't have to! I prefer to get into C as soon as possible, so let's see how little assembler we can get away with, and see what trips us up next! :

## armc-08-start.S

```
.section ".text.startup"

.global _start
.global _get_stack_pointer

_start:
    // Set the stack pointer, which progresses downwards through memory
    ldr     sp, =0x8000

    // Run the c startup function - should not return and will call kernel_main
    b       _cstartup

_inf_loop:
    b       _inf_loop


_get_stack_pointer:
    // Return the stack pointer value
    str     sp, [sp]
    ldr     r0, [sp]

    // Return from the function
    mov     pc, lr
```

Not bad! There's not exactly a lot there to set up the stack pointer. The stack is placed at the start of our program and grows downwards through memory. You don't need a large amount of memory for the stack.

Some important information about the `.section declaration`. With the linker script, I can see in rpi.x that the following text sections are available:

```
.text           :
  {
    *(.text.unlikely .text.*_unlikely)
    *(.text.exit .text.exit.*)
    *(.text.startup .text.startup.*)
    *(.text.hot .text.hot.*)
    *(.text .stub .text.* .gnu.linkonce.t.*)
    /* .gnu.warning sections are handled specially by elf32.em.  */
    *(.gnu.warning)
    *(.glue_7t) *(.glue_7) *(.vfp11_veneer) *(.v4_bx)
  } =0
```

This is also the order in which the text section is linked together by the linker. The standard functions generally go in the standard .text section. Therefore, we can put our _startup function before the main `.text` section by putting it in the `.text.startup` section. Other than `.text.unlikely` and `text.exit` which we won't use, `_startup` will be the first thing to go into the text segment which is where execution will start at 0x8000

Then, we're in C for initialising the bss section:

## armc-08-cstartup.c

```
extern int __bss_start__;
extern int __bss_end__;

extern void kernel_main( unsigned int r0, unsigned int r1, unsigned int atags );

void _cstartup( unsigned int r0, unsigned int r1, unsigned int r2 )
{
    /*__bss_start__ and __bss_end__ are defined in the linker script */
    int* bss = &__bss_start__;
    int* bss_end = &__bss_end__;

    /*
        Clear the BSS section

        See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss for further information on the
            BSS section

        See https://sourceware.org/newlib/libc.html#Stubs for further
            information on the c-library stubs
    */
    while( bss < bss_end )
        *bss++ = 0;

    /* We should never return from main ... */
    kernel_main( r0, r1, r2 );

    /* ... but if we do, safely trap here */
    while(1)
    {
        /* EMPTY! */
    }
}
```

Again, not that bad and pretty reasonable. NOTE: We've now changed from main to kernel_main, and there's a reason for this - the bootloader is actually expecting a slightly different entry definition compared to the standard C main function. So as we're setting up our own C-Runtime anyway, we can define the correct entry format. The correct bootloader entry point defines a couple of values which we can check to know what system we're booting.

The actual C code hasn't really changed apart from the kernel_main difference:

## armc-08.c

```
#include "rpi-gpio.h"

/** GPIO Register set */
volatile unsigned int* gpio = (unsigned int*)GPIO_BASE;

/** Simple loop variable */
volatile unsigned int tim;

/** Main function - we'll never return from here */
void kernel_main( unsigned int r0, unsigned int r1, unsigned int atags )
{
    /* Write 1 to the GPIO16 init nibble in the Function Select 1 GPIO
       peripheral register to enable GPIO16 as an output */
    gpio[LED_GPFSEL] |= (1 << LED_GPFBIT);

    /* Never exit as there is no OS to exit to! */
    while(1)
    {
        for(tim = 0; tim < 500000; tim++)
            ;

        /* Set the LED GPIO pin low ( Turn OK LED on for original Pi, and off
           for plus models )*/
        gpio[LED_GPCLR] = (1 << LED_GPIO_BIT);

        for(tim = 0; tim < 500000; tim++)
            ;

        /* Set the LED GPIO pin high ( Turn OK LED off for original Pi, and on
           for plus models )*/
        gpio[LED_GPSET] = (1 << LED_GPIO_BIT);

    }
}
```

We again confirm with nm that everything is ordered at least something like sensible:

```
\arm-tutorial-rpi\part-2\armc-08>arm-none-eabi-nm kernel.elf

000080f8 A __bss_end__
000080f4 A __bss_start
000080f4 A __bss_start__
000080f0 D __data_start
000080f8 A __end__
000080f8 A _bss_end__
000080a8 T _cstartup
000080f4 A _edata
000080f8 A _end
0000800c T _get_stack_pointer
00008008 t _inf_loop
00080000 N _stack
00008000 T _start
000080f0 D gpio
00008018 T kernel_main
000080f4 B tim
```

Yup, looks good - _start is at 0x8000 where execution will start. Stick it on the card and make sure the OK LED is blinking still. I appreciate that we're doing a lot of work where you can't see more interesting results - but it'll get better soon, I promise! For now we're getting a great foundation for developing in C for the bare metal Raspberry-Pi. Knowing what your tools are doing is pretty essential!

## The C-Library stubs

Now that we've got the C-Runtime pretty much setup, we can implement the C-Library again with our own C-Runtime startup and C-Library stubs. This is where we want to get to - easy compiling with the C-Library being linked in so that we can make use of the C-Library functions on the Raspberry-Pi without an operating system.

We are actually linking against the C-Library, but we're not using anything from within it. Therefore, the linker disregards the whole of the C-Library because there are no references to it within the code. Let's jump straight in and malloc some memory as I know that requires a stub. Compile armc-09 without the *-cstubs.c and you'll see the error:

```
.../arm-none-eabi/lib/fpu\libg.a(lib_a-sbrkr.o): In function `_sbrk_r':
sbrkr.c:(.text._sbrk_r+0x18): undefined reference to `_sbrk'
collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

So the malloc call is calling something in the c library called _sbrk_r which is a re-entrant safe (or multi-thread/interrupt safe) C library function all called _sbrk. This is the C-stub function that we must implement as it is operating-system dependant.

It's worth looking at how other people have implemented these function calls. Look at them to see what they're doing. Generally you can look at other kernel code, or embedded system code:

[http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-763.12/emulated/brk.c](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-763.12/emulated/brk.c)

[http://linux.die.net/man/2/sbrk](http://linux.die.net/man/2/sbrk)

However, the best place is if examples are in the C-Library you're using! Newlib is well documented and [includes example minimal systemc calls/stubs](https://sourceware.org/newlib/libc.html#Syscalls).

We implement this in the next tutorial armc-09

## armc-09-cstubs.c

```
#include <sys/stat.h>

/* A helper function written in assembler to aid us in allocating memory */
extern caddr_t _get_stack_pointer(void);


/* Increase program data space. As malloc and related functions depend on this,
   it is useful to have a working implementation. The following suffices for a
   standalone system; it exploits the symbol _end automatically defined by the
   GNU linker. */
caddr_t _sbrk( int incr )
{
    extern char _end;
    static char* heap_end = 0;
    char* prev_heap_end;

    if( heap_end == 0 )
        heap_end = &_end;

     prev_heap_end = heap_end;

     heap_end += incr;
     return (caddr_t)prev_heap_end;
}
```

```

Build the example and program, now the counter variable is from malloc'd memory - usually malloc is the most mysterious of the c library stubs, but as you can see from the example, you can implement it easily and also implement it in C easily too! Of course occasionally it's necessary to drop down to assembler to get certain register values or talk to some special hardware features. Keep the [cheat-sheet](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.qrc0001l/QRC0001_UAL.pdf) close at hand while you're working with the C-Stubs.

## Part 3

In the next part of the bare metal tutorial, we'll add on a build system so that we're not using a silly single command-line, and we can harness the power of a full build system for our bare-metal environment. We'll then fall back to the Cambridge ASM tutorials and progress to using the timer for flashing the LED rather than the incrementing loop counter we've used so far.

So, what are you waiting for? Head off to [Part3](http://www.valvers.com/embedded-linux/raspberry-pi/step03-bare-metal-programming-in-c-pt3) now!
