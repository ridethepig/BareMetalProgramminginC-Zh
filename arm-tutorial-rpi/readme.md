# Raspberry-Pi Bare Metal Tutorial

This repository contains the code for the Raspberry-Pi bare-metal programming
in C series. The home of the tutorial and all of the articles relating to the
code is at
[valvers.com](http://www.valvers.com/open-software/raspberry-pi/step01-bare-metal-programming-in-cpt1/)

You can build on linux, windows, or MAC - all you need is the
[https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded](arm-none-eabi toolchain).

For all platforms, you can get the required toolchain used in this tutorial
from the [GCC-ARM-embedded](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) project - I
recommend getting the 4.7 toolchain because I've had problems with the 4.9
toolchain.

Have fun, and remember to experiment!
